# Spells

Magic system, spell lists, and casting mechanics.

## Overview

In this system, spells are nodes on the [[Ability Tree]]. There are no traditional spell slots - instead:
- Spells have stat-based prerequisites
- Spells cost resources (Mana, Stamina, etc.) or have cooldowns
- Spells scale automatically with your stats

See [[Ability Tree]] for how spell unlocking and scaling works.
