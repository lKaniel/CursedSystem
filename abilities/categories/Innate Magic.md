# Innate Magic (Sorcerer)

Natural spellcasting - magic you know instinctively.

## Overview

Innate Magic represents spells you **KNOW** - they are part of you and can be cast freely without needing books or patrons.

**Stat Requirements:** *Intellect + Arcana OR Awareness + Survival*

## How It Works

- Spells are **remembered/known** permanently once learned
- No spellbook required
- Cast using Mana
- Can combine arcane and nature magic

## Spell Progressions

Each spell exists as its own ability on the tree. Spells are linked in progression chains, with more powerful spells requiring knowledge of earlier ones.

## Learning Spells

To unlock an innate spell:
1. Meet the stat prerequisites
2. Spend 1 Ability Point
3. Have the prerequisite spell learned (if any)

Once learned, spells are permanently known and can be cast by spending Mana/Stamina.

## Scaling

All innate spells automatically scale with your relevant stats:
- **Damage** increases with Arcana or Survival
- **Healing** increases with Awareness/Survival
- **Save DCs** always use: 10 + (Primary/2) + (Secondary/2)
- **Duration/Range** often improve at specific stat thresholds
