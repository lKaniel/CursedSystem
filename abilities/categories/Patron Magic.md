# Patron Magic

Power granted through sacred oaths and eldritch pacts with otherworldly entities.

## Overview

Patron Magic is fundamentally different from [[Innate Magic]] and [[Grimoire Magic]]. Instead of knowing spells or inscribing them, you **channel power directly from a patron entity** - a deity, demon, archfey, great old one, or primordial force.

**Core Concept:** Limited daily uses of powerful abilities, granted and empowered by maintaining your patron relationship.

## How Patron Magic Works

### The Pact
When you take your first Patron Magic ability, you form a **pact** with a specific entity type. This grants you:
- **Pact Slots:** Limited daily uses of channeled power
- **Patron Spells:** Specific spell list based on your patron
- **Invocations:** Permanent passive abilities from your patron
- **Obligations:** Requirements to maintain the pact

### Pact Slots (Daily Power)
Unlike mana-based magic, patron casters use **Pact Slots**:
- Start with **2 Pact Slots** at level 1
- Gain **+1 Pact Slot every 3 levels** (3, 6, 9, 12, 15...)
- **Fully restore** on Long Rest (8 hours)
- Can restore **1 slot** on Short Rest (10 min) if you honor your patron during rest

**Using Pact Slots:**
- Spend 1 slot to cast any patron spell you know
- All patron spells cast at your current power level (scale with stats)
- No mana cost, only slot cost
- Still costs stamina (SP) to cast

### Invocations (Permanent Boons)
Invocations are **always-active** abilities granted by your patron:
- Don't cost pact slots
- Don't require concentration
- Represent your patron's influence on you
- Unlock through progression
- Can have up to (Presence/4 + Awareness/4) invocations active
