# Grimoire Magic

Scholarly spellcasting through arcane grimoires - vast spell libraries at the cost of preparation and restrictions.

## Overview

Grimoire Magic is a **tome-based** magic system where you acquire and master mystical grimoires. Unlike [[Innate Magic]] where you know spells instinctively, grimoires allow you to inscribe and cast **unlimited spells**, but with significant drawbacks that diminish as you master the grimoire arts.

**Core Concept:** Trade flexibility and spell variety for increased costs and casting restrictions.

## How Grimoire Magic Works

### The Grimoire
- A **physical artifact** containing inscribed spells
- Can hold **unlimited spells** (no spell known limit)
- Must be **in hand or nearby** to cast from it
- Can be lost, stolen, or destroyed
- Takes time to inscribe new spells

### Casting from Grimoire

**Base Restrictions (without mastery abilities):**
- Costs **+50% Mana** and **+3 SP** more than the spell's base cost
- Requires **1 action (3 SP)** to reference the grimoire before casting
- Must have **at least one hand free** to hold/reference the book
- Cannot cast while **moving** (must be stationary)
- Spell takes **1 round longer** to cast (delayed to next turn)
- Some spells require **material components** or **ritual conditions**

**Why Use Grimoires Then?**
- Learn **any spell** you find (scrolls, other grimoires, research)
- No ability point cost to learn spells (only to acquire grimoire mastery)
- Can have **hundreds of spells** available
- Abilities in the tree **remove restrictions** and **reduce costs**
- Eventually becomes **more powerful** than innate casting

### Learning Spells

**Once you have a grimoire, you can inscribe spells by:**
- Finding spell scrolls (common treasure)
- Copying from other grimoires (with permission or... acquisition)
- Researching in libraries (costs time + gold)
- Quest rewards and discovered arcane texts
- **No ability point cost** - just time and resources

**Inscription Cost:**
- Time: 2 hours per spell tier
- Gold: 50g × spell tier
- Must meet spell's Intellect/Arcana prerequisites to inscribe
