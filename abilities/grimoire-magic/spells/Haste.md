## Grimoire Casting Costs

## Effect
Choose a willing creature within range. For the duration, the target gains:

### Speed Benefits
1. **Doubled Movement Speed:** Movement costs half SP (0.5 SP per 5 feet)
2. **+2 AC:** Supernatural reflexes make them harder to hit
3. **Advantage on Agility Saves:** Enhanced reaction time
4. **Extra Attack:** One additional weapon attack per turn (uses normal SP cost)

### Example
Fighter with 30-foot movement:
- Normal: 30 feet = 6 SP
- Hasted: 60 feet = 6 SP (doubled distance for same cost)
- Also gets +2 AC, advantage on Agility saves, and one extra attack

## Scaling
- At Arcana 26+: Can target 2 creatures (both get full benefits)
- At Arcana 32+: Can target 3 creatures
- At Arcana 38+: Duration increases to 10 minutes
- At Arcana 44+: Can target 4 creatures
- At Arcana 50+: Hasted creatures also gain +1 to all attack rolls

## Special
**Lethargy Effect:**
When the spell ends, the target suffers 1 level of exhaustion (per [[Stats System]]) for 1 round as time catches up to them.
- This can be dangerous if the target is at high exhaustion already
- Plan for the crash

**Concentration:**
Requires concentration. If you lose concentration:
- Spell ends immediately
- Target suffers lethargy
- Wasted resources

## Tactics
**Best Used On:**
- Heavy attackers (extra attack is huge)
- Tanks who need the AC boost
- Scouts who need the movement
- Characters with powerful single attacks

**Combos:**
- Haste on heavy weapon fighter = massive damage output
- Haste on archer = more arrows per turn
- Haste on yourself if you're a gish (warrior-mage)

## Inscription
