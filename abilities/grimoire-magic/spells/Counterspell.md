# Counterspell

## Description
Interrupt an enemy's spellcasting with a precisely-timed disruption of their arcane formulae.

## Prerequisites (to inscribe)
- **Intellect:** 14
- **Arcana:** 18

## Details
- **Type:** Grimoire Spell (Abjuration Reaction)
- **Category:** [[Grimoire Magic]] - Abjuration
- **School:** Abjuration
- **Tier:** 3

## Base Costs
- **Mana:** 12 MP
- **Stamina:** 3 SP
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Cooldown:** Reaction (when you see a creature casting a spell)

## Grimoire Casting Costs
**Without Mastery Abilities:**
- Mana: 12 MP × 1.5 = **18 MP**
- Stamina: 3 + 3 = **6 SP**
- **Problem:** Cannot cast as reaction due to reference delay!
- Must have [[Rapid Reference]] minimum to use this spell

**With [[Rapid Reference]] + [[Mana Efficiency]]:**
- Mana: **12 MP**
- Stamina: **6 SP** (3 base + 3 grimoire)
- Can cast as reaction
- Grimoire must be accessible

**With Full Mastery [[Effortless Casting]]:**
- Mana: **12 MP**
- Stamina: **3 SP**
- Clean reaction casting

## Effect
When you see a creature within 60 feet casting a spell, you can attempt to counter it.

### Auto-Counter
If the spell costs ≤ (Your Arcana - 8) MP, it is automatically countered.
- Arcana 18: Auto-counter spells costing ≤10 MP
- Arcana 26: Auto-counter spells costing ≤18 MP
- Arcana 34: Auto-counter spells costing ≤26 MP

### Contested Counter
If the spell costs more than your auto-counter threshold, make a contested roll:
- **Your Roll:** d(Intellect/2 + Arcana/2) + (Intellect/2 + Arcana/2)
- **Their Roll:** d(Intellect/2 + Arcana/2) + (Intellect/2 + Arcana/2)
- **Success:** Spell is countered and has no effect
- **Failure:** Spell proceeds normally, you spent MP/SP for nothing

## Scaling
- At Arcana 24+: Range increases to 90 feet
- At Arcana 30+: Can counter two spells per round (if you have the resources)
- At Arcana 38+: Countered spells refund half your MP cost
- At Arcana 46+: Range increases to 120 feet

## Special
- **One of the most valuable grimoire spells**
- Can shut down enemy mages completely
- Requires good positioning and reaction timing
- Synergizes with high Arcana builds
- Can counter [[Innate Magic]] spells (they don't know it's coming)

## Tactics
- Save resources for countering big spells
- Auto-counter cheap spells to conserve resources
- Position within 60 feet of enemy casters
- Use [[Battle Caster]] to counter while in melee
