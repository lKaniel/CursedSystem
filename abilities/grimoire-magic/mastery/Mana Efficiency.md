# Mana Efficiency

## Description
Through countless hours of study and practice, you've learned to cast grimoire spells without the usual mana overhead.

## Prerequisites
- **Intellect:** 14
- **Arcana:** 16

## Details
- **Type:** Passive Ability
- **Category:** [[Grimoire Magic]] - Cost Reduction
- **Cost:** 1 Ability Point
- **Cooldown:** N/A (Permanent)

## Effect
Remove the +50% mana penalty from grimoire casting. Your grimoire spells now cost **base mana** only.

### Before vs After
**Before Mana Efficiency:**
- Spell costs 10 MP base
- Grimoire casting: 10 + 50% = **15 MP**

**After Mana Efficiency:**
- Spell costs 10 MP base
- Grimoire casting: **10 MP** (same as innate casting)

## Scaling
- At Arcana 24+: Grimoire spells cost -10% mana (90% of base cost)
- At Arcana 32+: Grimoire spells cost -20% mana (80% of base cost)
- At Arcana 40+: Grimoire spells cost -30% mana (70% of base cost)

**This makes grimoire casting MORE efficient than innate casting at high levels!**
