# Perfect Cut

Master technique that ignores armor on critical hits.

## Type
Weapon Technique - Passive

## Prerequisites
- **Previous Skill:** [[Iaijutsu Strike]]
- **Stats Required:** Agility 20, Light Melee 20

## Effect
Your blade finds the gaps in any defense.

**Passive Benefits:**
- Critical hit range increased to 18-20 (instead of 19-20 from Blade Mastery)
- On critical hit, ignore enemy's armor bonus to DC
- On critical hit, roll damage dice three times instead of two

**Special:** Once per long rest, you can declare an attack to be an automatic critical hit (still must hit their base DC)

## Example
Enemy has DC 25 (10 base + 10 Agility + 5 armor).

Normal critical: Roll against DC 25, deal triple damage dice.

Perfect Cut critical: Roll against DC 20 (ignoring +5 armor), deal triple damage dice.

Auto-crit (once per day): Declare Perfect Cut, roll against DC 20, automatically critical if you hit.

## Scaling
Works with any sword damage, scales with your weapon choice and stats.

## Unlocks
None - This is a master-tier ability.
