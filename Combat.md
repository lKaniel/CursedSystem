# Combat

Battle mechanics, initiative, actions, and resolution.

## Overview

This system uses a **resource-based combat** model instead of traditional action economy.

**Key Features:**
- **No action/bonus action limits** - everything costs Stamina, Mana, or HP
- **Three core resources:** Hit Points, Stamina Points, Mana Points
- **Stamina recovers 50% each turn** - you can always act
- **Reactions cost stamina** - choose between offense and defense
- **Attack as many times as you have stamina for**

See [[Combat System]] for full detailed rules.

## Core Resources

### Hit Points (HP)
- Formula: `20 + (Endurance × 5) + (Fortitude × 2)`
- Your life force
- Recover on rests and healing

### Stamina Points (SP)
- Formula: `10 + (Endurance × 2) + (Stamina × 3)`
- Used for movement, attacks, abilities, reactions
- **Recover 50% at start of your turn**

### Mana Points (MP)
- Formula: `(Intellect × 3) + (Awareness × 2) + (Arcana × 2)`
- Used for spells and magical abilities
- Recover on rests, potions, special abilities

## Action Economy

Everything costs resources:
- **Movement:** 5 feet = 1 SP
- **Light Attack:** 3 SP

- **Reactions:** Variable SP (if you have stamina left)

No limit on actions - only resource limits!
