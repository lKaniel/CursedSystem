Long ago mortals were given a taste of a power given only to those who were commonly referred to as gods. Those powers were so immensely great and useful that became revolutionising. While some embraced the discovery to move forward, others feared for old order - that newly acquired potential would destroy current distribution of power and wealth.

# On the Nature of Arcane Arts

_A Treatise for Prospective Students of the Endang Academy_

---


Many wish to learn that most wondrous of skills which we call "arcane," commonly referred to by the common folk simply as "magic." The history behind it is long and reach in discoveries, to say the least. Each day brings us something new to study—sometimes faster than we can properly master what came before.

The most advanced nation, the one to stand above others in matters of arcane, was the Kingdom of Endang, with schools and academies that have been continuing research for centuries. And it is peerless today too. Through tireless study, we have discovered magic that sets aflame and freezes, summons wind and water, transforms matter, seeks friend or foe, sets mind at ease - anything your heart desires. 

## What Is Arcane?

Arcane - first and foremost is a phenomenon, emergent property of this world, that occurs as result of mana manipulation, intentional or not, by forces internal or by reacting to environment. Some may find that tidbit of information not exciting enough. Those, who think so should ask another question—"what can you do with it?" And answer to that is much better at catching attention.
"Simply put, magic can do and undo anything, give anybody whatever they might desire," is a famous phrase by professor Karl Bekkenheim. While this is theoretically true, to properly use arcane is no small feat. Especially considering that nobody truly knows _how_ it works—not at its deepest level. But if one meets, sometimes truly ridiculous, conditions, then the impossible  becomes possible.

While it remains unknown whether arcane has its limits—as was stated previously, according to current theory - it does not—there is one thing we understand: how it affects our bodies. Whenever we cast what is called "spells"—certain combinations of will, mana manipulation and physical interactions, that under precise execution produce expected and consistent results—we utilise our body's internal resources.

## On the Nature of Manna

While some may mistakenly describe spellcasting as mere stamina drain, we have proven that mortal bodies contain what we term "manna"—a source of energy that allows one to control and produce arcane effects.

Manna is something we know a great deal about, while simultaneously knowing almost nothing. We understand how to measure its quantity, how to increase it through training and meditation, how to utilise it, deplete it, and regain it through rest. Under laboratory conditions, we have even succeeded in extracting manna into vessels—elixirs that can be sold to the masses, providing much-needed restoration to those whose reserves run low.

However, even with our current scientific understanding of the mortal body, we do not know how manna is produced, nor how our bodies utilise it in a way that conjures arcane. These mysteries remain, perhaps forever beyond our grasp.

## The Three Methods of Casting

What we know with certainty is how spells are cast. There exist three distinct methods, which we shall cover in this paper.

### Grimoire Casting

The first and most common method is "grimoire" casting—essentially, reading and visualising spells that have been previously discovered, while meeting the correct conditions. This method grants access to any spell one can mentally learn or read, provided sufficient materials, manna, and general control over arcane energy are present. While this approach is quite versatile, it is the least efficient of the three methods, as considerable energy is lost in the translation from written word to magical effect.

### Innate Casting

The second method is innate casting. In most cases, one is born with this gift, though there exist documented cases of individuals achieving it through years of dedicated practice and passion. Innate casting allows the one to cast spells at will, simply by thinking of the desired effect and converting their manna directly into pure arcane energy. This makes far more efficient use of one's reserves. However, innate casters are typically limited to specific domains—a fire mage may cast flame effortlessly but struggle with even simple water spells.

### The Third Path

The third method of spellcasting I am reluctant to include in this academic paper, as it is far less studied and cannot truly be called scientific magic. It involves bargains with entities beyond our understanding, drawing power from sources that exist outside the natural order. The Academy does not teach this path, and for good reason. Students are _strongly advised_ to avoid such dealings, no matter how tempting the promised power may seem.

## The Dangers of Arcane

It would be remiss not to address the dangers inherent in arcane practice. Overexertion of one's manna reserves can lead to what scholars call "the Hollow"—a state of profound exhaustion where the body begins consuming itself to fuel incomplete spells. In severe cases, this has proven fatal.

Furthermore, spells cast incorrectly may produce wildly unpredictable results. A poorly pronounced fire incantation might ignite the caster rather than the intended target. A transformation spell gone awry may leave the subject trapped between forms. The arcane does not forgive carelessness.

There are also those who become addicted to the feeling of power that magic provides. Such individuals push themselves ever further, burning through their manna, damaging their bodies, all in pursuit of greater and greater magical feats. The Academy has protocols for identifying and helping such students, but prevention through proper education remains our primary defence.

## Classification of Spells

From your logical understanding, the only type of casting we can reliably teach is grimoire casting. While it is not the purest form, it requires no specific talents or heritage, making it accessible to all who possess the dedication to learn.

Spells, as we know them, have categories and variants—though these classifications exist merely for convenience and understanding. In truth, there appear to be no fundamental limitations to what arcane can or cannot accomplish. However, we find it useful to organise magic into schools: elemental magic (fire, water, wind, earth), manipulation magic, healing and supportive magic, illusion, divination, and many other categories and subcategories.

Such structure helps students understand what lies ahead. Once you learn a spell of fire nature, for example, it becomes considerably easier to delve deeper into more advanced fire spells. The patterns of thought, the mental frameworks—they build upon one another. Thus we have "specialists" who dedicate themselves to particular schools, and "generalists" who spread their studies broadly. Whatever path you choose, you are welcome to pursue it here.

## Welcome to the Academy

And so we invite students to learn arcane at our academy. The teachings here will provide you with the ability to understand, practice, and master spells. Our library holds grimoires dating back centuries. Our instructors have dedicated their lives to this craft. Our facilities include protected practice chambers, alchemical laboratories, and meditation gardens designed to help students expand their manna reserves.

Whatever path you may wish to choose—specialist or generalist, scholar or practitioner—you are welcome to try and accomplish it. This is what we tell our students, and it is true for anyone who seeks knowledge of the arcane.

May your manna run deep, and your casting true.
