# Obsidian TRPG System Vault

This is an Obsidian vault dedicated to designing and documenting a custom online tabletop role-playing game (TRPG) system, inspired by D&D and similar systems.

## Project Purpose

This vault serves as the comprehensive design space and documentation for a TRPG system. I'm building this system from scratch and need help filling it with detailed content, mechanics, and interconnected rules.

## System Components

The TRPG system includes the following core areas:

- **Spells** - Magic system, spell lists, casting mechanics, spell schools
- **Combat** - Battle mechanics, initiative, actions, attack/defense systems
- **Equipment** - Weapons, armor, items, magical gear, and economy
- **Social Interactions** - Dialogue systems, persuasion, intimidation, relationships
- **Character Creation** - Classes, races, attributes, backgrounds, progression
- **Game Mechanics** - Core rules, dice systems, skill checks, saving throws

## Working in This Vault

When helping develop this TRPG system:

- Create detailed, well-structured notes for game mechanics
- Use Obsidian wiki-links `[[note-name]]` to connect related concepts
- Maintain consistency with D&D-inspired mechanics while being creative
- Organize content logically with clear headings and formatting
- Add examples to clarify complex rules
- Consider game balance when designing mechanics
- Think about how systems interact with each other

## Obsidian Linking Convention

**IMPORTANT**: In Obsidian, the note's **filename** (not the title/heading) is what you use for linking.

- A file named `Fireball.md` with title `# Fireball Spell` is referenced as `[[Fireball]]`
- The first H1 heading in the file can be different from the filename
- Wiki-links use the filename without the `.md` extension
- When creating notes, choose meaningful filenames that work well for linking
- Example: `[[Wizard]]` links to `Wizard.md`, regardless of what the H1 heading says inside

## File Organization

Please help organize the vault using a clear folder structure:

- `/Core Rules/` - Fundamental game mechanics
- `/Character Creation/` - Classes, races, backgrounds
- `/Magic System/` - Spells, casting, magical items
- `/Combat/` - Battle rules, conditions, actions
- `/Equipment/` - Weapons, armor, items, economy
- `/Social/` - Social interaction mechanics
- `/Templates/` - Reusable templates for consistency

## Note-Taking Style

- Use markdown headers for clear hierarchy
- Include stat blocks and tables where appropriate
- Add tags for easy filtering (e.g., #spell, #combat, #equipment)
- Cross-reference related concepts frequently
- Keep notes modular and interconnected
