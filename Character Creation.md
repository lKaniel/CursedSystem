# Character Creation

Character creation for a classless system: stats, abilities, races, and backgrounds.

## Overview

This is a **classless system**. Instead of choosing a class, you build your character through:
1. Distributing stat points
2. Selecting starting abilities from the [[Ability Tree]]
3. Choosing a race (optional)
4. Selecting a background for flavor
